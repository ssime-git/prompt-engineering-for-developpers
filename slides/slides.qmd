# What is Prompt Engineering?
## A Discipline at the Intersection of Art and Science

- The art and science of designing effective prompts for AI models
- Crucial for getting the best results from language models
- Bridges the gap between human intent and AI output

::: aside
prompt engineering is a discipline that focuses on designing effective prompts for AI models. It bridges the gap between human intent and AI output, allowing us to get the best results from language models.
:::

# Why is it Important?

- Improves AI model performance
- Reduces errors and hallucinations
- Enhances user experience
- Saves time and resources

::: footer
Let's talk about why prompt engineering is important and how it can benefit us.
:::

# Key Principles

1. Be specific and clear
2. Provide context
3. Use examples (few-shot learning)
4. Break complex tasks into steps
5. Iterate and refine

## Practice on Be Specific and Clear
